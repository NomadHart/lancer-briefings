Born as a ordinary person in an ordinary life. Ryota was never special. Never the most athletic or most popular. He didn't have much in the way of friends or companions. He drifted through life born into a family that was respected in his community. His father was a researcher at a biotech company. Who spent more time surrounding himself with his work than spending time with his family. Not that he had much to come how to besides his son as Ryota's mother is a freelance contract Lancer engineer for the Big Five. She would often be away from home for long periods in order to support the interests of whoever hired her. Ryota never knew much about it. Never really cared. That's why when his father mysteriously died in a lab explosion, he wasn't all that shaken. His mother on the other hand was beside herself. She quit her job and decided to be mechanic out of her personal workshop nearby their apartment. This enabled her to be able to spend more time with Ryota but he was already well into his teens. His mother was a stranger to him. The omninet raised him in his opinion. Not his parents.

At age 16 he first got into the hacking game. He had seen dramas and movies and various other mediums depicting it. He thought it looked fun, thrilling even. He had always had a knack for computers and systems (he assumed he could thank his mother and father for that). So when a his "friend" Cascade on a everything forum he frequented told him about a fun way to learn he jumped at the opportunity. It was difficult but he used the resources Cascade had provided him with to get about 500 Terabytes of data from the entry point he was told about; wiping the files from the server int he process. Thinking it was just some random small company he left a file to let them know who was responsible. It just read "G0dC0mPl3x". A shitty name for a shitty 16 year old. After that high of taking something that didn't belong to him; he began to look into the data. Turned out it was from Horus. It contained schematics and other classified information. Ryota in a panic got back into the server he broke into and put the data back leaving no trace but forgetting about the simple file he left. 

The next 5 years were a blur of seeking that rush again. Ryota would take on any job. Try any system, network, you name it. Every time he'd just leave that simple file: G0dC0mPl3x. He didn't limit himself to just the omninet. Sometimes he would go onsite and link in that way. He was a kid high on the danger. Then a Horus infosec officer came knocking at his door. After a lot of threats about the legality of what he had done the officer admitted he was impressed. And offered Ryota a job. He took it and spent the next 10 years working with and against the Big Five (and many different biotech, NHP, weapons, data, and health companies). He became a metaphorical ghost. He never took anything unless he was strapped for cash but always left his calling card. 

After running around the omninet for years he was greeted one day by an old friend, Cascade, who was a recruiter for a mercenary outfit. He told Ryota the thought he could put his talents to a different use and maybe find that high he's been seeking for the last 15 years. Ryota initially declined but after a few run ins with some infosec officers and private militias hired by some higher ups who wanted to bring the menace G0dC0mPl3x down. He figured it would be beneficial to learn how to fight and have some potential back up. So he accepted the offer and now uses his call card as his callsign: G0dC0mPl3x

Behavioral and Psych Evaluation:

Mr. Lajos seems to not have many interpersonal or familial connections. He acts in a very independent and self centered manner. Possibly due to his family neglecting personal time with him until he was in he mid teens. Mr. Lajos also appears to have never truly gotten over his father's death. This could be part of the reason he "thrill seeks".

Summary:

Mr. Lajos is in fairly good health but has a few vitamin deficiencies. These are easily correctable. Mr. Lajos unfortunately also suffers from trauma due to his father's death and general neglect from his family. He seems to find it difficult to make connections that are not through the omninet. This combined with his thrill seeking attitude and his "need for stimulation" make him a weak candidate for a group without a strong Hierarchy.
